In this project I will be making a fixed background website.
Its simple and easy to understand and apply. Results are neat.

For this in the webpage folder we have to place index.html and create three folders css, images and js
The css folder will have the style sheet named: style.css
The images folder will have images, of 1920x1080 72 resolution, for the background of the different sections.
The js (java script) folder would contain app.js file.

I will attempt to cretae a standard template code so I can change basic componenets and create new websites rateher quickly.
