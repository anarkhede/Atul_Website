In this project I will be making a fixed background website.
Its simple and easy to understand and apply. Results are neat.

For this in the webpage folder we have to place index.html and create two folders css and images
The css folder will have the style sheet named: style.css
The images folder will have images for the background of the different sections.

I will attempt to cretae a standard template code so I can change basic componenets and create new websites rateher quickly.
